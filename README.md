# Design Decisions

A place to document various Almight project design decisions for development reference.

## Process - Public Discussion

1. Create Issue explaining the detail of idea or specs
2. Discuss 
1. Create a pull request by filling out the [template](/AIP/aip-1.md) and saving it under a unique name. Add the `aip` code to related issues when closing them.
1. Discuss
1. Document arguments for and against
1. Merge the pull request
1. Document the decision inside [AIP](/AIP/) as well as [Spec Docs in Notion](https://almight-workshop.notion.site/Protocol-v1-da5c5820960849d18f84daad68d1ef7b)

## Workflow
1. Issues seggregated and converted into milestones
2. Based on the specs related with the issue the implementation of code will begin.
3. Multiple issues can also be converted into single AIP and then can be transferred to implementation stage.
4. Only AIPs will be implemented to code and no AIP except `Final` will be implemented to code.
